Rule-Based Chatbot with Regular Expressions and Random Responses
This Python project implements a rule-based chatbot that leverages the re library for regular expression matching and the random library for generating random responses.
Features
 * User Input Interpretation: Employs regular expressions (re) to comprehend user inquiries.
 * Knowledge Base: Maintains a repository of responses to match various user inputs.
 * Randomized Responses: Injects randomness (random) into responses for a more natural conversational flow.
Getting Started
 * Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (https://www.python.org/) and the re and random libraries installed (pip install re random).
 * Clone the Repository: Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL and run:
   git clone <repository_url>

 * Run the Chatbot: Execute the Python script (e.g., main.py) to launch the chatbot.
Usage
Interact with the chatbot by providing text input. The chatbot will attempt to parse your input using regular expressions and select an appropriate response from its knowledge base, incorporating some randomness for a more engaging experience.
Further Development
 * Expand the knowledge base with more diverse responses.
 * Refine regular expressions for more accurate input interpretation.
 * Integrate natural language processing (NLP) techniques for enhanced understanding.
Disclaimer
This is a basic rule-based chatbot and may not handle complex conversations or nuanced language. It serves as a foundation for further development and exploration of more sophisticated chatbot techniques.
